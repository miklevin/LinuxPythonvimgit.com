This is one for the history books. I have taught my wife enough Linux to load
vim and enough vim to write Python.

But what about git? Hmmm. I used to think that one should take up Python first
through Jupyter Notebooks, then put off Linux, vim & git for as long as
necessary until the time is right. Then Microsoft fixed the WSL install on
Windows 11 to merely just be:

    wsl --install

Then I realized the age of easy-install Linux was upon us. It can be done under
a still-working version of Windows, so you have all your drivers, device
support, game compatibility and whatnot. There's no searching around, making
decisions, choosing Linux versions. About the only decision is whether you type
that command from a DOS Command window (COM) or a Windows Powershell. Either
will do the trick perfectly well. But after the command finishes, you'll have
Ubuntu 20.04 (as of the time of this writing) installed and running right in
the window you ran the command from.

So, things are different. It is no longer necessary to defer the Linux and vim
part of the experience. Quite the contrary, the vim part of the experience is
so very challenging, central and pivotal to making the transition to... what?
Another kind of human being in the same way engineers, musicians and athletes
are other kinds of human beings, that the sooner you begin this transformation,
the better. The only reason I deferred this transformation in the past is
because of how hard it was to get an everyday Linux system. Before Windows 11,
the wsl --install step still had a few show-stopping steps that followed,
namely turning on the hypervisor and doing a few reboots. It was too difficult
for the mainstream. It is not anymore.

vim is too difficult for the mainstream, you say? Yeah, Microsoft'll have you
believe that. They bought Github, built-in Linux and hired the creator of
Python. But what are they going to do about vim? Crush it with VSCode, of
course! You will use VSCode. You can depend on that. Microsoft needs you to
depend on that, for if you learn vim, you will have a viable path to
platform-independence, and that can not be allowed.

So get your ass to vim! Do it now! It's already installed on your machine. Run,
Forrest, run! Use vim and don't ever look back!

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="zKr3dhdZMFo" %}

Once you're on vim through WSL, you're already on Linux. Use vim to make a
file:

    vim hello.py

From inside the file, learn enough vim to write and save:

    print("Hello World!")

The keystrokes by the way are:

    i
    print("Hello World!")
    [Esc]
    :wq
    [Enter]

Okay, now from the command-line that you've returned to, type:

    python hello.py

Hit Enter, of course. It shouldn't need to be said, but after venturing into
vim for maybe the first time, I guess it does have to be said. A lot of assumed
keystrokes in everyday instructions have to become considerably more precise
when discussing vim.

And you'll see the output of your Hello World program. Okay, so now you know
Linux, Python and vim.

But what about git?

Honestly, git's the hardest of my recommended set of tools now. Sure, Linux,
Python and vim have so very, very, very, very, very much more to explore and
learn. But look, you can be functional with all three in just a single sitting.

    wsl --install
    echo "print('Hello World!') > hello.py
    python hello.py
    vimtutor

Okay, so now you know Linux, Python and vim. The rest is details.

But there's nothing like this for git. git eludes. git is still mysterious.

git builds upon assumed Linux knowledge that one might not have.

git requires initialization.

git requires initiation.

Put off git until the time is right.

Nervousness, tap, tap, tap... all that code not backed up. No undo. No ability
to flow it onto other computers. A laptop crash would be devastating... tap,
tap, tap... still, no git?

But when will the time be right?

What's that Nat? You want to web-publish like I do?

Well, I guess the time has come the Walrus said to speak of that great and
awesome git's other main contribution to the free and open source world. This
massive git of git's first and largest contribution of course being Linux
itself. Linus Torvalds wrote git. Linus named it after himself.

This is appropriate given Linus' awesome creativity inventing the product from
scratch, as Ken Thompson, the creator of Unix, will tell you about Linus and
Linux and Bitkeeper's creator Larry McVoy will tell you about git. I am quite
sure Larry called Linus a git before Linus named git git.

At least Linus knows himself well. However, this wants me want to bang my:

    git reset --hard HEAD^^^^^^^^

But I get ahead of myself. Let's keep the geek jokes to a minimum. They only
infuriate those sincerely trying to learn.

Nat asks to web publish like me. Okay, so it's time to teach her...

Github Pages!!!

Okay, take a deep breath. You thought Linux, Python and vim were challenging.
Okay, let's just start with Github Pages. Why? Because:

- It lets you publish markdown as web pages (no HTML-knowledge necessary)
- Creating a markdown is quick and easy in vim.
- It forces us to learn enough git to make a local "repository"
- It forces us to get that repository up on Github
- Then your website is just a few Github / Settings away.

Okay, assume being in a Linux terminal but with little Linux experience, either
on operation or terminology. It can all be rather intimidating and
overwhelming, so break it down Barney-style.

- First is explaining what a git "repository: is.
- Next is explaining what the git program itself is.
- Then we have to explain what using a command-line program in a terminal is.

Okay, here we go:

- git is a command-line program (probably already on your machine)
- We have to check if it actually is on your machine.
  - It usually is on recent versions of Linux (which you are on)
- To check if we have git:
  - Open a Terminal, which is also known as:
    - A shell
    - The command-line interface
    - CLI
  - As an aside, the Window versions which are similar but not Linux, are:
    - COM (the command window)
    - Powershell
  - None of this will work from the Windows versions
  - You can tell the difference between them based on their prompt
    - Both COM and Powershell use the greater-than ">" as their prompt
    - Linux uses the dollar-sign "$" as its prompt

Aside from very few special cases, I am never talking about COM or Powershell.
These have very little use except to install Windows software. We used COM to
install Linux with the wsl --install command. That's the last we should ever
have to use COM or Powershell as far as I'm concerned.

But we now have the Linux command-line. The preferred way to get to the Linux
command-line (a.k.a. Terminal, Shell or CLI) is through the new Windows
Terminal program, available through the Microsoft Store.

I am about to show you how to use the git program from the Linux command-line.

So we have a Linux command-line open and ready to use. We have it by running
Microsoft Terminal. Our default is set to Ubuntu 20.04. If it's not, change the
default to Ubuntu 20.04. That way whenever we want a Linux terminal, we open
Microsoft Terminal and it's instantly there.

Go to your Linux command-line.

The next step is to show you how to read the git --help without needing to
scroll-up. We have turned off the ability to scroll-up in a Linux command-line
so that vim doesn't get messed up with the scroll-wheel. This is a good thing
and we should keep it that way.

To show git help, we type:

    git --help | less

Now we are displaying the output of git --help, but we are "piping" it through
the program called "less".

The above command should be read as: show git's help, but pipe its output to
the program called less.

Piping is sending the output of one program into the input of another program.
This allows us to read all the help easily, even if it's taller than the
screen.

What would normally "scroll past" us and be lost off the top of the screen is
now all sent into a program that lets you navigate the text with the same keys
vim uses, including the q key to get exit the "less" program.

Okay, a word about how git "fits into" the overall picture.

The tools I use are really just 4 (plus Jupyter), so 5, really. But Jupyter is
for learning. The first 4 I expect I'll be using till the day I die.

- Linux
- Python
- vim
- git

git is important because your files must be:

- In more than one place
- Optionally very, very secret. To your satisfaction... enough for a journal.
  Why?
  - Because Microsoft bought Github
  - Github is the most popular place for git repos
  - Microsoft has their reputation and stock value on the line
  - A leak of private info that is their fault will be on the front page of the
    newspapers the next day and make their stock value plummet, lose customers,
    lose faith, and begin an inevitable downfall of the company.
  - Microsoft will not intentionally let private repos leak.
  - Much more than a person's private journal is at stake. Proprietary code
    worth millions or billions is kept this way, too.
  - It is easier these days for your local machine to be hacked than for
    Microsoft to screw up with this.

What is a git repo, or "repository"?

It is a folder (a.k.a. directory). Those words are interchangeable.

The Linux command to make a folder (a.k.a. directory) is mkdir

When you run mkdir, it makes the directory in the location where you are in the
command-line.

So you want to look at where you are to make sure it's where you want the
folder to be made, and you can do that with:

    pwd

pwd means path of working directory.

The first step is to find out where the Operating System compels you to be.
It's always easy to start there.

From that location, I create a github folder.

- After starting up your computer, it is a "blank slate". Nothing is running.
- When you run a Terminal (a.k.a. command-line, shell or CLI), you are "home"
- When you run pwd, you will see that home is /home/ubuntu/
  - This is where the (Linux) OS "compels" you to be... home.
  - It is from here, you mkdir... but with good nicknames.
  - The most important nickname in my mind is github.

So open a terminal and type:

    mkdir github

This is already done.

Now we can:

    cd github

To make ourselves "inside" the github folder.

- From inside the github folder, we can make new directories.
- The names are important because those are about to be "repos".
- Repos start out as ONLY git repos on your own (local) computer.
- Even when it's on Github, it can STILL be kept private (but not published as
  a website if you're using free Github)
  - Github lets you keep a few private repos
  - But you cannot share other people into them
  - And you cannot turn them into Github Pages websites
- For our purposes, we will need a public repo.

So we cd into github

Then we mkdir on a name that will soon be a public repo.

    mkdir publishme
    cd publishme
    git init
    ls
    ls -a

You can see that there is a "hidden" .git folder made as a result of git init.

    vim index.md

This is the preferred file-name for a homepage under the Github Pages
publishing system. Write some markdown.

    git status
    git add index.md

There is now a .git folder in this location. In the next step, we:

 - Go to github.com
 - We select the + in the upper-right and select "New repository"
 - We put our cursor in the Repository name box and type the exact same name as
   the folder we're working from on our local computer.
 - We scroll down and we hit "Create repository"

We go back to the command-line and type:

    git commit -am "My first commit"
    git config --global user.email "youremail@somewhere.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

In the above instructions the git config commands only have to be done once per
computer.

We're almost there.

    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin git@github.com:gitusername/publishme.git

This reaches a point where some special public/private key (file) generation
must be done. Usernames and passwords don't work anymore on a git push.

Of the work we've done so far, there's definitely 2 separate parts:

- That which is 1-time startup stuff
- That which is recurring every time stuff

It is time to figure out how to get rid of passwords on git.

    cd ~/.ssh

If it doesn't exist, make it.

    mkdir ~/.ssh
    cd ~/.ssh

From inside ~/.ssh:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email@address.com"

Hit Enter to keep the answers blank, which is fine.

Check git origin with:

    git remote -v

Set the remote origin to have the username in it. All git repos on your
computer (local) in preparation for going onto a website like Github (remote as
in elsewhere) need to have that elsewhere-location set. The below example is an
actual real-world example. It's nuts, but it really is
git@github.com:[username]. The username being embedded tells it from which
Github user it should look for a public key. Therefore we are going to have to
generate a public key and put it on Github.

    git remote set-url origin git@gihub.com:miklevin/pipulate.git

Conceptually, we got to the end in our earlier session. This last step of
pushing shows that "authentication" (like username/password) is so often the
most difficult part of an entire process.

Because Microsoft is fighting against hacking, they locked down the security on
Github. Using a username and password is no longer possible on things like:

    git push

For the same reason sites are insisting on 2-factor authentication these days,
Github is insisting on better security. Using a username and password is
actually less secure than alternatives that involve public/private key files.
These keys live in a very standard location on Linux. That location is:

    ~/.ssh

This is the same as:

    /home/ubuntu/.ssh

The dot before the folder-name makes the folder "invisible" just like a .vimrc
file. It's not supposed to show up in a normal:

    ls

...listing of a folder's contents. But it will show if you use:

    ls -a

...because the "-a" forces Linux to show "all" files, including those starting
with a period "."

So, then we have to actually generate those keys. The get created with a
command-line program called ssh-keygen. Like "git", ssh-keygen was already on
your Linux. This is because these tasks are so so common these days that most
modern Linux like Ubuntu 20.04 which you're using have it pre-installed. So you
don't have get it.

The command we used is:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email@address.com"

Of course replace the email with the one you use for Github.

This command prompts you 3-times for things. None of them are important. You
don't need that level of security. So by just hitting Enter to each of the
questions, you will end up with 2 keys in that folder:

- id_rsa
- id_rsa.pub

The first one is the secret part of the key. It does not get given out. It
stays on your machine. It's no big loss if you really lose it one day, because
you can regenerate a new public/private-key pair. That's what these are. And
you would just put the new public key where it goes, Github, for example.

So the CONTENTS of the public key named id_rsa.pub is going to go onto Github.

Once it's there, this command will work, although you will have one more "yes"
to answer if everything is done correctly. After that yes, you will be able to
just "git push" whenever you like. The first git push has to be this (after
you've added the public key to Github).

    git push -u origin main

When a folder is turned into a git repo with the git init command, many things
are not set yet.

If it's the first time using git on that machine, some of these settings are
"global", meaning not for the repo in particular, but for your whole Linux
system.

When first we tried anything that actually tried connecting to Github, we
started getting challenged to meet its requirements, including setting our
email and name. Those commands it made us do were:

    git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Of course, replace with your own.

Now the "global" in these commands meant (as I NOW know) a .gitconfig file was
created in home, a.k.a. ~/.gitconfig a.k.a. /home/ubuntu/.gitconfig, and as
such can be edited with:

    vim ~/.gitconfig

...which contains:

    [user]
        email = email@gmail.com
        name = Your Name

That is just an FYI, little bonus. It was the first challenge of connecting to
Github. The 2nd challenge was much bigger because it first demanded a username
and password, and then told us that was not good enough, starting August of
2021.

To get the public key onto Github:

    cd ~/.ssh
    less id_rsa.pub

Use your mouse pointer to click-drag from the beginning to the end (including
your email address). This requires Windows Terminal to be set up for
click-dragging to copy into the Windows OS copy/paste buffer. This is a very
good idea. Do it.

Next, you go to Github / settings / SSH and GPG keys

Click New SSH Key.

Give it a title like "My Key"

Paste the public key text into the Key field

Click Save SSH Key

Now the command:

    git push -u origin main

...will work. Almost there! Remember to answer "yes" to the question that pops
up. It will add github to a "known_hosts" file in ~/.ssh. You can go look at it
with vim because it's sometimes necessary to delete lines out of there.

Last (after a successful push):

- Go to Github / Repository you want to publish as a website
- Go to Github / Settings (for the Repo) / Pages
- Select Source Branch: main
- Hit Save

Your site is punished. It will give you the link.

From here on out:

- Edit index.md
- git commit -am "Something"
- git push

Git pushing will go smooth from here on out.

New files can be added, but you must also git add and commit them as well.

Refer to Jekyll documentation, especially regarding "Front Matter" to control
details like title tags and URL it gets published on.
