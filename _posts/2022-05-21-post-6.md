We're starting a lesson and will begin with a review of yesterday, but not
everything from yesterday, because we covered so much. We will hit the
essentials. Those essentials are:

1. We are using Linux through Windows Terminal.
2. From Windows Terminal, a.k.a. command-line or shell or CLI, which we know by
   the $ prompt, we can use such programs as:
   - vim
   - git
   - less
   - echo
   - ls
   - cd
   - pwd
3. For web publishing, git is the one we're using right now.
   - There is a publishing system built into Github called Github Pages.
   - Github Pages uses another system called Jekyll
   - Jekyll takes markdown files and turns them into pretty HTML files
   - Those HTML files are accessible from URLs such as:
   - https://natlevin.github.io/publishme/
4. We learned quite a bit about git
   - We learned some of it's history, that it was written by Linus Torvalds
   - We learned that a folder (a.k.a. directory) can get turned into a git
     repo (a.k.a. repository)
   - We learned that these git repos can also be kept on Github
   - We learned how to use git (a little bit)
5. These are the git commands we learned:
   - Start by going to the Terminal
   - cd to where we want to make a new directory from
   - mkdir newlocation
   - cd newlocation
   - echo

So what is echo? Echo as a command, a.k.a. program that works like "print" from
other systems such as kornshell and Python.

The trick with echo is that it's normal use is this:

    echo "Hello World"

But you can also use it like this:

    echo "# Hello World" > index.md

...which actually creates the file by "redirecting" the output of echo into a
file. This is similar to the "piping" trick we learned yesterday, but instead
of the pipe | symbol to a program, it's the greater-than > symbol to a file.
Using >> will make it create or append instead of create or replace.

Once the file exists, you can go into it with vim:

    vim index.md

Once you're in vim, you can practice markdown and macros.

Macros start by navigating to where you want it to begin.

This is often the beginning of a line for "easier control" reasons.

Hit the "q" key, and then one of the keys "a" through "z". I usually choose "a"
because of never having to think about it. I record a macro, it goes in a. But
this is a choice. These are "registers". They are the same registers you would
use the double-quote (") to copy into.

So macros go into registers.
Normal copy/paste can go into the same registers.
This may seem like a conflict, but it's really cool for pasting recorded macros
into your .vimrc.

If your .vimrc is already loaded, pasting a macro for permanent future use is
as simple as pasting it into the .vimrc and "wrapping" it in:

    let @x = '[paste recorded macro here]'

And from that point on whenever you run vim, you can play back that macro by
typing:

    @x

Once you've played back a macro, say to insert an html line-break, you don't
have to keep typing @x which is a little tedious. You can keep your finger on
the shift-key and tap @@ which will replay the last macro.

In such a way, you can run the macro on each line in a list, so long as going
back to the beginning of the line and down 1 line is at the end of the recorded
macro.

I do this particular macro so much that I actually haven't put it in my .vimrc
so that I keep reminding myself how to record macros and that it's a good idea.

foo bar<br/>
foo bar<br/>
foo bar<br/>
foo bar<br/>
foo bar<br/>

This has led me to such macros as turning...

    some-keyworded-image.jpg

...into:

    ```markdown
    ![Some Keyworded Image](some-keyworded-image.jpg)
    ```
Okay, so we have done some practice markdown. Next step, publish!

Save and exit.

Turn folder into github repository by typing:

    git init

Next, we add index.md to the new git repository by typing:

    git add index.md

Next, we commit the changes by typing:

    git commit -am "something"

The next step is on Github. We make a new repo using the + in the upper-right,
give it a name that matches the folder on your machine.

It's going to give the commands.

The 2nd to last line is wrong. It gives https where it should give
git@github.com.

To fix this, click "SSH" before copying the last 3 lines to execute. You should
see something like:

    git remote add origin git@github.com:miklevin/experiment.git
