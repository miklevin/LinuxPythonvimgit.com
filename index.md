Learn Python, vim & git and become obsolescence-proof and disruption-resistant
in tech and life. I'm not talking about Linux desktops. Desktops don't matter.
I mean old-school Linux, Python, vim & get which you get to through the
Unix-like type-in terminals built into Macs and easily installable as the
Windows Terminal through the Microsoft store. It doesn't matter what platform
you're on: Windows, Mac or Linux. You can get started on your journey to
obsolescence-resistance and disruption-proofing today. I'm not in this for the
money. I'm one of those unicorns on the net, sincerely here to help.

It's going to take some discipline.
